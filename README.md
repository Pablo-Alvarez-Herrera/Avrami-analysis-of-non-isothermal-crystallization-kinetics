Analysis of crystallization kinetics under non-isothermal conditions at five different cooling rates.
The script:
- Determines the Avrami exponent (n) and rate constant (k) for each cooling rate
- Evaluates the crystallization completion (halt) time
- Generates Avrami plots and compares experimental and model-predicted conversion as a function of temperature

User input:
- Conversion vs. temperature data for five cooling rates
